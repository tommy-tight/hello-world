My name is Tommy Tight and I am a senior at Notre Dame studying Business Analytics and Spanish. I am originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota. I am a big sports fan and I love playing and watching Golf and Hockey. After graduating from Notre Dame, I hope to work in Data Science and I would love to live in New York.
